The present code reflects the epitomy of "release early release often". Don't it expect it to do much of anything It should, however, largely test (rspec) clean.  See http://taxonworks.org for some background.


=== Requirements

TaxonWorks is presently a Rails 4.0 app running on Ruby 2.0 (required) and MySQL 5.x.  A PostgreSQL branch is under development and PostgreSQL will ultimately be used in production.

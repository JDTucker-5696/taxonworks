# A container item is something that has been "localized to" a container.  We can't say that it is "in" the container, because not all containers (e.g. a pin with three specimens) contain the object.  By "localized to" we mean that if you can find the container, then its contents should be locatable.  
#
# @!attribute container_id
#   @return [Integer]
#     id of the container  
#
# @!attribute position
#   @return [Integer]
#     index for acts a list, set by code 
#
# @!attribute contained_object_id
#   @return [Integer]
#     the id of the object that is contained (Rails polymorphic)
#
# @!attribute contained_object_type

#     the type of the object that is contained (Rails polymorphic)

# @!attribute localization
#   @return [String]
#   some additional modifier arbitrarily defining the position of this item, aka disposition [@todo, always relative to container?!]

#   the project ID

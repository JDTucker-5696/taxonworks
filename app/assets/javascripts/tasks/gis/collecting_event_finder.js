  // TODO: To be filled in later.
  // intended for use as event handler for the collecting_event selector, based in one of three methods:
  //  1)  by named geographic_area, using the geographic_area ajax
  //  2)  by circle or polygon (maybe also square/rectangle)
  //  3)  by pointing to a map and selecting an enclosing geographic_area (Rich's suggestion)
